<h1 class=header-inprogress>About Me</h1>
<div class="p-about">
<p>Tom Patterson was born in 1962. He was born in Victoria, British Columbia; he is an artist who does native artwork for a living. He began carving back in 1977 at the age of fifteen. Tom studied under
Tony Hunt Sr for more than ten years before going solo.
</p>

<p>Tom has since done totem poles, masks, rattles, plaques, paddles, ceremonial regalia,
headdresses, canoes, and much more. His Artwork has been showcased around the whole world in
many museums; for example museums in Britain. As an indigenous artist; Tom has shared his culture
and history through his work. Tom loves to teach people about indigenous culture through stories
about his artwork.</p>

<p>The way of an artist is evergoing; tom has never stopped learning new ways to incorporate
different styles in his artwork. He may have more than 40 years of experience under his belt, but
can an artist ever reach the peak of that ever-growing mountain?  </p>
